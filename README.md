# Text Encrypter
This project is a text encryption application designed to encrypt and decrypt words using predefined rules. It exclusively operates with lowercase letters and does not accept accented characters or special symbols. Users can input text into a designated field and choose between encrypting or decrypting it. The result is displayed on the screen. Encryption rules are straightforward: certain vowels are replaced by specific words, and vice versa. For instance, *"a"* becomes *"ai"*, *"e"* transforms into *"enter"*, *"i"* changes to *"imes"*, *"o"* is replaced by *"ober"*, and *"u"* becomes *"ufat"*. The project also features functionalities for copying the result to the clipboard and removing unauthorized characters.
